# Software-estimation
Prediction of software development cost is an extremely important task before starting the actual development phase. Software products are acceptable by clients as long as they are developed within the lower budget. Software estimation is one of the most challenging areas of project management. Machine learning algorithms are used to handle these type of problems. Machine learning algorithms increase project success rates. software simulation using machine learning algorithms could further enhance project estimation methods and contribute to better resource allocation and utilization. The proposed effort and duration estimation models are intended to serve as a decision support tool for any organization developing and implementing software systems. ISBSG dataset is used for this implementation. Results show that machine learning models can be used to predict software cost with high accuracy rate.
